"""
Tests the orchestrator's dispatch logic and guardrail wiring, not actual
agent output quality (that's not something you can assert on
deterministically against a real LLM anyway). Mocks out the actual
CrewAI/PydanticAI calls so these can run without Ollama or a GPU.

Needs crewai + pydantic-ai installed to even import agents.orchestrator -
couldn't be executed in the build environment for that reason. Once
dependencies are installed:
