"""
Claim Adjudication Team, per the doc:
    Agent 1 (OCR/Extraction) -> Agent 2 (Coverage Validator) -> Agent 3 (Payout Assessor)

This crew doesn't decide anything final - it produces a recommendation
that still has to go through a human agent (see api/v1/claims.py
decide_claim endpoint). The Payout Assessor's number is a suggestion, not
an approval.

Note on the LLM: the doc says "open-weight LLMs (Llama 3, Qwen 2.5, or
DeepSeek)" without picking one or saying how it's served. I went with
Ollama serving llama3 by default since that's the simplest way to run an
open-weight model locally - change OLLAMA_MODEL / OLLAMA_BASE_URL if
you're running something else.
